title: CodeStream codemarks section
metaDescription: "The codemarks section provides a list of open, resolved, and archived CodeStream comments."
---

Whether they originated in a pull request, a feedback request, or through ad hoc code comments/issues, codemarks are the [discussions](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/discuss-code) that annotate your codebase. The codemarks section of the CodeStream pane lists all of the codemarks in your current repository for easy reference.

<figcaption>Different sections and colors separate the codemarks by their status: open, resolved, or archived.</figcaption>

Click any item in the codemarks section to review its details and discussion. With the exception of pull-request comments, bubbles to the right show the number of replies.

By default, all codemarks from the current repository are displayed, but you can change the filter to show all codemarks in the current branch, codemarks in the current folder, or codemarks in the currently selected file.

Codemarks from feedback and pull requests only appear when you've selected the current file filter.

When you hover over the codemarks section heading, the following icons appear at the right:

The codemarks header includes options to create a code comment or issue. You can also choose to view the codemarks in a spatial view, instead of in a list. The discussions are displayed alongside the blocks of code they refer to, and as you scroll the source file the discussions scroll as well.

Click the gear icon for more controls over the list.

* **Wrap multi-line comments**: Rather than showing a truncated portion of the codemark, the list shows the whole post is displayed.
* **Show tags**: Any applicable tags will be displayed with each codemark.
* **Sort comments by**: By default, Codemarks are ordered by date, but when the filter is set to current file you can sort by line number (such as, their order in the file).
* **Show icons in editor gutter**: In addition to appearing in the list in the codemarks section, codemarks are also represented as icons in the editor gutter alongside the blocks of code they refer to. You can determine which types of codemarks, and which statuses, you want to have displayed there. By default, codemarks from feedback requests are displayed, but pull request comments are not. Resolved codemarks are also displayed by default, but archived codemarks are not.
