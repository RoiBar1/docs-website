title: CodeStream filter and search tool
metaDescription: "The CodeStream filter and search tool helps you find specific comments, issues, and feedback requests."
---

New Relic CodeStream's filter and search tools enable you to slice and dice your organization's collection of comments, issues, and feedback requests however you see fit. By default, youâ€™ll get a view of any open issues or feedback requests assigned to you, followed by all open issues and feedback requests.

## UI overview [#ui]

You can also use advanced search syntax to create your own searches and you can save them for future use via the bookmark icon at the right side of the search box.
