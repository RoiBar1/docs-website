title: CodeStream activity feed
metaDescription: "The CodeStream activity feed provides a continually updated list of new comments, issues, and feedback requests."
---

The activity feed is the definitive place to find out about new comments, issues, and feedback requests posted by your teammates or new replies to existing discussions. When you’re not on the activity feed, you can always tell whether or not there’s anything new by looking for a badge on the activity feed icon. A
blue badge with a white dot means that there are new discussions or replies.

CodeStream’s section in your IDE’s status bar also let’s you know when there are new messages in the feed.

The filter at the top of the activity feed controls what you see
in the feed.

* **Activity from everyone in my organization**: See all of the  activity from your organization. We only recommend this for small organizations.
* **Activity associated with code open in my IDE (default)**: See discussions related to code in the repositories you have open in your IDE.
* **Activity associated with code in selected folder**: Use this option if your team is working within monorepos. See discussions related to code in the currently selected folder.

Regardless of your filter settings, you'll always be notified when you're @mentioned.

As you might expect, new stuff gets added to the top of the feed, even if it’s a new reply to a very old discussion. CodeStream also adds a blue border to the left of new activity to flag it for you.

Here's a new reply to a comment. Only the replies have a blue border, because the comments has already been seen.

**See 1 earlier reply** means that there's an earlier reply that's already seen. Only new, unread replies are displayed in the main activity feed view, but you can click on that link to see the full discussion thread and add a new reply of your own.

The activity feed goes all the way back to the beginning of time for your team, but if you’re looking for specific, older codemarks you might be better off using our [filter and search](/docs/codestream/codestream-ui-overview/filter-search) tools.
