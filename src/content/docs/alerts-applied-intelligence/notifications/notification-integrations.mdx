  ## Permissions [#jira-permissions]

  The required permissions from the Jira `API-Token` are `create`, `edit`, and `close` tickets.

  To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira `API-Key` should have an `Admin` role.

  ## Set up a Jira destination [#set-up-jira]

  Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced.

  To create a Jira destination, enter the following information:
  * **Destination name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
  * **Jira account endpoint:** The URL of the destination.
  * **User-name:** The email address of the user making the connection.
  * **API token:** generated from your Atlassian account.

  <Callout variant="important">
    New Relic currently supports [Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-team-managed-and-company-managed-projects/). 
  </Callout>

  Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the **Test connection** button.

  ### Two-way sync [#jira-two-way]
  * **Closure of New Relic Issue:** triggered when the JIRA issue status changes to done.
  * **Acknowledgment of New Relic Issue:** triggered when the JIRA issue status changes to in-progress.
  You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the two-way integration toggle.

  When turned on, a [Jira Webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) is created in your Jira account at a later stage for the selected project. The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and API key).

  ## Configure the message template [#configure-jira-message-template]

  To configure a template for a Jira issue: 
  
  1. Choose a destination. You can create a new destination at this stage. 
  2. Upon successful connection to the destination, choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. 
  3. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. 

  To help you get started, we automatically populate the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields using the `X` mark on their right side.

  ## Send a test notification [#send-jira-test]

  You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values.

  If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear.

  />    

  ## Roles [#roles-servicenow]

  As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your ServiceNow incident table, and other optional values. We require the following permissions:

  * Read permissions for the tables `sys_dictionary`, `sys_choice`, `sys_user`, and `task`. 
  * Read/write permission to `incident`.
  * To fetch users for the `caller` column, you need read permissions for the `sys_users` table.

  The roles `personalize_choices`, `personalize_dictionary`, `rest_service`, and `itil` have the above permissions. 

  Read/Write permissions to the `api_key_credentials` table is required to enable two-way integration. The roles `credentials_admin` and `discovery_admin` provide these. 

  ## Set up a destination [#set-up-service-destination]

  To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information:

  * **Destination Name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
  * **Domain:** The URL of the destination.
  * **User-name:** The name of the user.
  * **Password:** The user's password. 

  Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.

  ![A screenshot of a ServiceNow destination configuration.](./images/serviceNow_destination.png "ServiceNow destination configuration.")

  ### Two-way sync [#two-way-servicenow]
   * **Closure of New Relic Issue:** triggered when the Servicnow incident state changes to resolved.
   * **Acknowledgment of New Relic Issue:**  triggered when the Servicnow incident state changes to in-progress.

  To configure the two-way integration:

  1. Turn on the `two-way integration` toggle. 

  2. Open and download this <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/newrelic-notifications/snow-two-way-sync/Newrelic-Snow-Sync-Configurations.xml" download="NewRelic-SNow-Sync-Configurations.xml">XML file</a>, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One.

  3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to **System Definition > Business Rules**.

  4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select **Import XML** and upload the XML file you downloaded.

  Once the destination is saved, a New Relic API-Key will be kept in the `api_key_credentials`. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New Relic.

  ## Configure the message template [#configure-servicenow-message-template]

  Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. 

  To help you get started, we automatically populate the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields using the `X` mark on their right side.

  ## Send a test notification [#send-servicenow-test]

  Click on **Test notification** to see ServiceNow incidents with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created, and a link will appear.

  ## Prerequisites [#slack-prereqs]

  Your Slack workspace needs to have the [New Relic application](https://newrelic.slack.com/apps/AP92KQJS3-new-relic?tab=more_info) installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users.

  ## Set up a Slack destination [#set-slack-destination]

  Click **one-click Slack authentication** to go to the Slack landing page, and continue the OAuth2 authentication process. If you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in.
  
  ![A screenshot of the one-click Slack authentication.](./images/slack_destination-authentication.png "Create a Slack destination with a click.")

  Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace, and click **Continue**.
  
  ![add a workspace.](./images/slack-sign-in.png "add a slack workspace.")

  When signed in to the selected workspace, allow New Relic to perform the specified actions.
  
  ![A screenshot permissions configurations.](./images/slack_destination_allow_access.png "select a workspace and configure permissions.")

  Click **Allow**, and return to the destination page.

  ![A screenshot completed authentication.](./images/slack_authentication_completed.png "authentication completed successfully.")

  ## Configure the Slack message settings [#configure-slack-message-settings]

  Select a destination (Workspace) and a slack channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated once to select private channels.

  ![Slack settings, user is not authenticated.](./images/slack_message-template-user-not-authenticated.png "Authenticate to select private channels.")

  ### Send a test notification [#send-slack-test]

  You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected slack channel.

  />       
      
  ## Set up a webhook destination [#set-webhook-destination]

  To create a webhook destination, you need the following:

  * **Destination Name:** A unique destination name.
  * **URL:** The endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed.
  * **Authorization mechanism (*Optional*):**. Can be `basic authentication` or a `bearer token`.

  ## Configure the webhook event template [#configure-webhook-event-template]

  Pick a webhook destination from the list, and configure the `HTTP-POST` request. 

  The request configuration requires you to:

  1. Set a name for the template.
  2. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one.
  3. Add custom headers (optional).
  4. Configure the request's payload.

  ## Customize the webhook payload [#customize-webhook-payload]

  You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your webhook.

  Note that the request's content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to be a JSON. See [Usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples). 

  The **Preview** section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, an error will be shown and it won't be possible to save the template. 

  ![A screenshot of an invalid Json payload.](./images/webhook-preview-error.png "An invalid Json payload.")

  If the webhook payload conforms a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination. 

  ![A screenshot of a test webhook notification template.](./images/webhook-notification-template.png "A test webhook notification template.")

  We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly.

  **Send email notifications to users**
    
  ## Set up an email destination [#set-email-destination]
  You don't need to create email destinations manually. These destinations are created automaticlly when a workflow is activated or updated. 
      
  ## Configure the email settings [#configure-email-settings]

  Add one or more recipients. 
  
  * Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address.
  * To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, enter their full email address.

  Every recipient will be translated into a destination. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the [notifications-log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/#notifications-log).
