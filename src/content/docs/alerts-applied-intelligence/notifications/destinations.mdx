Destinations are where we send notifications about your New Relic One data. A destination is a unique identifier for a third-party system that you use. 

Destination settings contain the connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic One.

The supported destination platforms include:

* Atlassian Jira
* ServiceNow
* Slack
* Webhook
* Email 


For more on these and other destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/notification-integrations).

<Callout variant="tip">
  It's also possible to configure destinations using the `aiNotifications` [NerdGraph  API](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/get-started-nerdgraph-api-explorer/).

## Required capabilities [#required-roles] 

Destination settings require specific [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#capabilities): 

* To access your settings: you need `View` capabilities for `Applied Intelligence:Destinations` or `Alerts`.
* To modify or delete your settings: you need `Modify` capabilities for `Applied Intelligence:Destinations` or `Alerts`.

### Destination status [#manage-destinations]

Destinations have a 'status' value that indicates if we encountered issues while processing and sending events to them (see the destinations table in the above image).
Some errors, like Authentication or Authorization issues, require an update to the destination's connection details. After the update, the destination status value will be changed to "Default".  

## Notifications log [#notifications-log]

To view past notification events details, go to the **Destination** menu, and click the **Notifications log** tab.

Notifications log enable you to view the history and status of all your past notifications. Here you can view the status of any notification along with related error details and destination ticket numbers.
